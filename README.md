## AviMail - a GMail Clone by Avi

AviMail, in a nutshell, is a GMail Clone mini-project. *nuf said*

Jokes aside, you can compose an "email" (sending actual email via the app is yet to be added) and it will automatically reflect and push the email to the list; Google authentication is also `enabled`.

**Note: Full functionalities of GMail is not integrated on this mini-project**

## Tech Stack

Front-End: `React`, `Redux`, `Redux Toolkit`, and `Material-UI` (for styling)

Back-End: `Firebase` (BaaS) 

## Just FYI

This mini-project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

Used BEM markup naming convention just to try it out.

**Side Note: BEM is not recommended for production level markup naming convention because of** *ehem* **ugliness** *ehem* **, readability, and extreme repetition.**
